## Augmented Reality related project on First Class of University 

In this project, I demonstrated how AR works on a browser. I used [jsartoolkit5](https://github.com/artoolkitx/jsartoolkit5) and [this](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_skinning_morph) animated model on threejs.

## Demo

You can try clicking right [here](https://emircanerkul.github.io/augmented-reality/). You need to give camera permission to the browser. Before using this demo you need some cards. Click [here](https://emircanerkul.github.io/augmented-reality/assets/data/cards.pdf) for downloading card file. After that, you need to print and cut four pieces and flip the left one for giving a command to the robot.

### Card Types
- 4E: Robot will be on this card. (4E stands for my group short name)
- B: When you show this card into the camera, the robot will be in standing mode.
- K: When you show this card into the camera, the robot will be in running mode.
- B: When you show this card into the camera, the robot will be in dancing mode.
- Z: When you show this card to the camera, the robot will jump.
- E: When you show this card to the camera, the robot will wave.
- Y: When you show this card to the camera, the robot will punch.
